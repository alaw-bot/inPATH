Introducing 'inPATH', our comprehensive solution featuring dedicated dashboards for both students and lecturers. 📚 On the lecturer side, functions include student enrollment, announcement dissemination, result management, and random desk allocation, enhancing administrative efficiency. 📝

Students can effortlessly create accounts using their registration numbers provided by lecturers, granting access to personalized details such as name, GPA, and attendance records meticulously updated through QR code scanning. 📊 They can also access announcements and easily locate exam seats, ensuring a seamless exam experience. 📍

Furthermore, leveraging machine learning techniques, students can explore the most suitable academic fields by inputting their semester results, utilizing insights from past senior students' academic journeys. 🧠
